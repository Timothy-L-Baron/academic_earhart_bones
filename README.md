Logistic Regression Analysis - The Amelia Earhart Case and Biological Gender Determination from Bone Length
This project was inspired by a CNN article about the Amelia Earhart case. Human bones were found on an island and somebody claimed they were Amelia Earhart's. There were conflicting scientific conclusions. There were few bones to work with.

The goal of this project was to see if bone length can be used to accurately determine biological gender.
